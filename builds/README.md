Version numbering in the `1.0.0.0` format typically follows the principle of "Semantic Versioning," which consists of 4 parts:

1. **Major version** — changes when there are incompatible changes in the application that require users to update. For example, if you change the application's architecture or remove functionality that could cause issues for users, you should increment the major version.

2. **Minor version** — increases when new functionality is added that is compatible with previous versions. This could include new features or improvements that don’t break compatibility with existing functionality.

3. **Patch version** — used for bug fixes or minor improvements that don’t affect compatibility with previous versions. For example, fixing bugs or improving performance.

4. **Build/Revision** — the fourth component (`0` in your example) can be used to distinguish different builds or versions, such as for internal testing or pre-release versions.

Example:
- **1.0.0.0** — first stable release.
- **1.1.0.0** — new features added without breaking compatibility.
- **1.0.1.0** — bug fixes in the stable version.
- **2.0.0.0** — major changes, new architecture, incompatible with previous versions.

Suffixes can also be used for more detailed designation:
- **1.0.0-beta** — beta version.
- **1.0.0-alpha** — alpha version.
- **1.0.0-rc** — release candidate.
